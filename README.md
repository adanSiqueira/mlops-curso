# mlops-deploy

This project sets up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of a Dockerized application to Google Cloud Run using GitHub Actions and Google Cloud Build.

The pipeline is triggered by any push to the main branch and performs the following automated steps:

Authenticates with Google Cloud using a service account or Workload Identity Federation.

Builds a Docker image using the cloudbuild.yaml configuration.

Pushes the image to Google Container Registry (GCR) or Artifact Registry.

Deploys the image to Cloud Run, making the latest code available in production automatically.

This setup enables automatic deployments to production on every commit to main, streamlining the release process and reducing the need for manual intervention.
